See also ChangeLog for details of those changes.

* Version 0.9.1.28

	*** Now dired-dd-delete-recursive() asks if the relevant buffer
	should be killed.

	*** Variable `dired-dd-delete-recursive-options' defaults ("-rf").

	*** locate-dired.el is refined to handle weird filename encodings.

* Version 0.9.1.27

	*** Files dropped by drag-mouse-2 on root window is always opened
	in a newly created emacs frame.

* Version 0.9.1.26

	*** [drag-mouse-1] and [M-drag-mouse-1] mark a file with the
	relevant mark if the file is already marked with a different mark
	as well.  Now you need not clear "*" with [drag-mouse-1] before
	marking with "D" by [M-drag-mouse-1]: You can use just
	[M-drag-mouse-1] no matter what mark is on it.  Of course
	[M-drag-mouse-1] clears "D" only when it is marked with"D".

* Version 0.9.1.25

	*** Now all the file dropped into *w3m* buffer, or opened via
	button 3 menu are opened with independent w3m process.  The
	behaviour is controlled by a new user option
	dired-dd-w3m-new-session defaulting t, which makes files dropped
	into *w3m* buffer are opened as new-session of emacs-w3m.  If
	dired-dd-w3m-new-session is turned off, only the first file marked
	in dired buffuer is opened. dired-dd-w3m-new-session is defined in
	dired-dd-w3m.el, so, if you don't install dired-dd-w3m.el and the
	default behaviour is desirable, (setq dired-dd-w3m-new-session t)
	in your .emacs(.el).

* Version 0.9.1.24

	*** A new file dired-dd-w3m.el in "non-dired-drop" directory,
	including a new handler function `dired-dd-w3m-drop-handler' to
	drop a file (perhaps an html) into *w3m* buffer. See
	http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/ for w3m, the emacs web browser.

	See the comments at the top of non-dired-drop/dired-dd-w3m.el
	to install.

* Version 0.9.1.23

	*** Now you can remove directories recursively even in
	/you@otherhost:/home/ via "Delete Recursive" [mouse-3]
	menu-item (you should be able to do rsh to the ftp host as well).

	*** Now you can copy-recursively files even when `from' or
	`to' directory is remote ftp directory (you should be able to
	do rcp between the ftp host as well).

	*** Now "w3m-open-local" item in the [mouse-3] menu.
	Requires emacs-w3m from
		http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/
	which works far better than `w3'.

* Version 0.9.1.22

	*** A fix on external command handler function
	dired-dd-exec-async-shell-command.
	Now you can include "&" in a dired-guess-shell-alist-user entry
	like this:

	("\\.jpe*g$"
	 "xv * &"
	 "display * &"
	 "my-jpg-cvt-script * &"
	 "animate * &"
	 "xanim * &"
	 "xli -onroot * > /dev/null")

	Older version didn't work as expected if "&" is included in the
	command lines.

* Version 0.9.1.21

	*** Workarounds for emacs-21, and CVS version of fvwm2.

* Version 0.9.1.20

	*** A new command [C-mouse-2] dired-dd-view-file available.
	Might be convenient while browsing through a directory full of
	jpeg files in emacs-21.x.

	*** dired-dd-watch.el dropped.  Found serious bug. Maybe
	it won't come back so soon, because the bug is related to
	the basic configuration of the program.

	*** "Copy Recursive" commands requires `file-name-coding-system'
	or `pathname-coding-system' to be setup correctly (in
	emacs-19/20/21), because now command `dired-dd-copy-recursive'
	is refined not to use dired-shell-stuff-it().
	`dired-shell-stuff-it' is totally useless for some multi-byte
	encoded (eg. SJIS) file names.

	*** Accordingly the format of variable
	`dired-dd-copy-recursive-command' is changed: Now this
	variable should be just a command name string (defauls "cp" --
	GNU cp is implied) and the commad option should be defined in
	new variable `dired-dd-copy-recursive-options' (defaulting
	'("-a")).

	*** "Delete Recursive" item (in B2, and B3 menu) is also fixed
	not to use dired-shell-stuff-it().  Accordingly, variable
	`dired-dd-shell-rm-R-command' is deprecated, and new variables
	`dired-dd-delete-recursive-command' (defaults "rm"), and
	`dired-dd-delete-recursive-options' (defaults `("-r")) are introduced.
	The new "Delete Recursive" handler is `dired-dd-delete-recursive'
	in dired-dd.el, which invokes `dired-dd-delete-recursive-command'
	in background (experimentally).

	*** There are many commands calling commands via `shell-file-name'
	left in dired-dd-b3-menu.el.  These might be fixed similarly, but
	they are not fixed, because they are thought to belong to a `kind' 
	other than that of "copy" or "delete" and fixing them might make
	the system inflexible.

	*** dired-dd.ps removed from the archive.

* Version 0.9.1.19

	*** Works on emacs-21.0.95.

	*** Now dired-dd-copy-recursive() (the "Copy Recursive" item
	in button 2/3 menu) copies files in asynchronous fashion.
	You can return to emacs even when you copied huge files.

	Thus dired-dd-copy-recursive() returns faster than normal key
	command `C' (dired-do-copy), or "Copy" menu item, so it has a
	merit to use even for plain files, especially when they are
	huge in size.

	Caveat: Target dired buffer *may* not be updated correctly
	after "Copy Recursive": hit `g' over there.

	dired-dd-copy-recursive() is fixed to handle filenames
	including shell meta-characters as well.

	*** Found that Shift-JIS encoded filename can be drag-and-dropped
	if
		(setq file-name-coding-system 'sjis)
	in emacs-20.7.	In mule-2.3 (19.28/19.34),

		(setq pathname-coding-system *sjis*)

	is rumoured to work, but it requires the mule to be built with
	--mcpath option, and I could not the test the feature for I
	have no such mule.

	*** "Delete Recursive" menu item is also in B2 menu.

	*** New command:
	C-M-down-mouse-2 (or S-down-mouse-3) (dired-dd-popup-shell-alist-menu)
	raises shell command selector for (marked) file(s).  It popups
	a menu of registered in dired-guess-shell-alist-user /
	dired-guess-shell-alist-default, associated with the filename
	extensions.  The selected command out of the menu is executed
	asynchronously.  As in case of M-mouse-2/double-mouse-1,
	number of the asynchronous commands is unlimited.  The B2-menu
	raised drag-mouse-2 also has entry point "Select Related CMD"
	to dired-dd-popup-shell-alist-menu.  The `related' shell
	commands should be listed directly in the B2-menu, but this
	feature is still in my TODO list.
	
	*** New program dired-dd-watch.el is included in the archive.
	It automatically fires up g (revert-buffer) with a timer
	interval so that you can `watch' the dired (or even non-dired) buffer.
	It adds a submenu in the B3 big menu (after "Refresh Listing"),
	and after "Revert Buffer" in system's [Files] menu.
	See docstring or the source for installation.
	Here is a brief description on the feature of dired-dd-watch.el:

	Hitting "`w" (in dired buffer: "`" is new prefix key),
	M-x dired-dd-start-watch-timer RET (in non-dired buffer),
	or selecting item "Watch Buffer" -> "Watch This Buffer"
	in the global menu-bar starts the `watch timer'.

	An interactive call C-u M-x dired-dd-start-watch-timer RET
	forces to refresh the buffer content even when you are
	in other buffer.  This forced refresh is controlled by a variable
	dired-dd-watch-current-only, which can be toggled
	through the submenu.  The watch interval is stored in a variable
	dired-dd-watch-timer-interval, whose default is 5 (sec).

	"`l" in dired buffer,
	M-x dired-dd-watch-list-timer RET in non-dired buffer,
	or menu item "Watch Buffer" -> "List watch timer"
	raises the list of `watch timer'.  The list works almost the same
	as in the output list from C-x C-b (list-buffers).
	You can use most of key bindings in `Buffer-menu-mode' as you
	may expect, and 3 more commands are available:

	g               (dired-dd-watch-list-timer)        ; refresh the list
	c               (dired-dd-cancel-listed-timer)
	i               (dired-dd-change-listed-timer-interval)

	Conceived to watch MP3 files arriving in ~/gnapster/MP3/downloaded,
	or watching various log file contents.

	*** dired-dd-watch.el are sort of experimental. May not be
	merged into dired-dd.el or dired-dd-b3-menu.el (at least) for
	a little while.

	*** New drop handler dired-dd-mpg123.el is added.  You can drop
	mp3 file(s), playlist(s), or directory(s) into the *mpg123* buffer.

	To get mpg123.el, see:
	http://www.gentei.org/~yuuji/software/mpg123el/

	See also my player MonK at http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~pi9s-nnb/monk/
	which supports dired-dd from the first.

	*** New add-on program dired-do-emacs-command.el.  Provides a command

	   \ (dired-do-emacs-command)

	in dired-mode (independent from dired-dd. Just depends on dired).
	Example:
	On "index.html" line in `dired' buffer, hit

	   \ w3-open-local RET

	opens the HTML file with `w3-open-local' command, or
	on "Hammerklavier.mp3", "ringo.m3u", or on directory "mp3files" line,

	   \ mpg123

	fires up mpg123.  `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' sort of command
	dictionary is not yet implemented.

	It may be advisable to

		(setq dired-dd-play-audio nil)

	if you use dired-dd-mpg123.el.

	*** Drag-and-drop into non-dired buffer via Keyboard (!) is supported.
	But, what's good with the `drag-drop' via KEYBOARD ?:

	Most of other dired-dd command/functions can be executed via
	equivalent keyboard command, but `non-dired' drop was a few
	exceptions in older `dired-dd' versions: there was no such
	keyboard command to drop files into MH/Mew/TiMidity/Monk/Gnus
	buffers.  Now these commands are available:

	| (dired-dd-exec-non-dired-drop-kbd)         : (1)
	C-| (dired-dd-exec-non-dired-drop-kbd-C)     : (2)
	C-M-| (dired-dd-exec-non-dired-drop-kbd-C-M) : (3)

	each equivalent to:

	(1) Plain drop       ([drag-mouse-2])
	(2) `CTRL' drop      ([C-drag-mouse-2])
	(3) `CTRL-META' drop ([C-M-drag-mouse-2])

	The dropped file is of course marked file(s) or a file on which
	current point is sitting on in case there is no mark in the
	dired buffer.  The targeg window is other (next) window to which
	you could switch to with C-x o (other-window) -- the drop fails
	if there is no such window.

* Version 0.9.1.18

	*** Item "Man & Info" in B3 menu is renamed to "Man, Info,
	HTML", and it has new sub-menu item "w3-open-local".  The item
	order in the sub-menu is also changed to mandoc, w3openlocal,
	then info.  w3 is assumed to be setup correctly elsewhere.

	*** The region swept by mouse button 1 will never be copied to
	to kill-ring, and the kill-ring top will never be affected.

* Version 0.9.1.17

	*** New variable dired-dd-no-fancy-stuff, and
	dired-dd-inhibit-bogo-profile. The former disables all the
	fancy facilities of dired-dd, and might be used to make
	dired-dd work on the disabled operating systems (but nobody
	tested that yet).  Setting dired-dd-no-fancy-stuff to non-nil
	automatically switches dired-dd-inhibit-bogo-profile to
	non-nil as well, which is implemented to avoid weird death of
	remote emacs-20 on my note PC (see ChangeLog in the package).

	*** Now "Delete Recursive" B3 menu item executes the relevant
	shell command in background. With this fix, the dired buffer
	may not be updated after the deletion, but I couldn't stand
	while I am deleting a big directory.

	*** Fixed the function dired-dd-copy-recursive corresponding to
	"Copy Recursive" in B2/B3 menu. GNU "cp -a" copies a directory
	differently dependig whether the target directory already
	exists or not, and this fix remedies the difference of the
	behaviour.

	*** New drop-handler dired-dd-lm.el for drag-and-drop into
	non-dired buffer, which creates a MIME mail framework in
	mail/article drafting buffer of Gnus, mew, mh-e, or a `Mail'
	mode buffer upon dropping MIME attachment file(s) from dired
	buffer. It requires lm.el (also newly included), which is a
	simple interface to /usr/local/bin/uuenview (which should have
	-a option). In lm.el, Japanese character coding-system handler
	is hard-coded, so perhaps the program does not make sense at
	all in drafting non-Japanese mail, sorry.

* Version 0.9.1.16

	*** Now most of shell commands invoked from mouse-3 are
	executed asynchronously.

	*** Supported drag-and-drop into timidity-mode buffer by
	dired-dd-timidity.el.
	Yet another sample of dired-dd-non-dired-drop-handler.

	Timidity is a MIDI soft-synthesizer, which has an emacs
	interface timidity.el.  M-x timidity RET (in an independent
	emacs frame, you may prefer that) creates a timidity buffer,
	and then, you can drop midi file(s) into it.  If you drop
	multiple MIDI files (they could be gzip'ed, timidity knows how
	to deal with them), the MIDI files are played in the mark
	order.

	Current timidity release is called TiMidity++, and can be
	retrieved (perhaps) from:

	http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity/

	*** Now non-dired-drop handlers are in `non-dired-drop' directory.

	*** 	Added more rational `find-other-win' command:
	S-mouse-2 (dired-dd-find-file-other-window)
	You can still use old the hairy mouse binding:
	C-S-mouse-2 (dired-dd-find-file-other-window)

* Version 0.9.1.15

	*** contrib directory added.  dired-dd-mime.el contributed by
	OKUNISHI Fujikazu <fuji0924@mbox.kyoto-inet.or.jp>, which is a
	`non-dired-drop' handler for dropping MIME attachment files
	into a draft buffers of Wanderlust
	(http://www.gohome.org/wl/), Gnus, mh-e etc.  Requires
	SEMI/MIME-Edit, or tm-edit.

	*** Added a mouse command [mode-line C-M-mouse-3] (mouse-delete-frame).
	If you want to use this command globally, refer to
	section "Using dired-dd in multiple window / frame environment"
	in dired-dd.info.

	*** Fixed a bug that async and sync shell commands invoked from
	M-mouse-2/double-mouse-1 or menu raised by mouse-3 can't handle
	filenames including whitespace or meta-characters.

	*** dired-dd-shell-command and dired-dd-shell-command2 in
	dired-dd-b3-menu.el supported "*" grammar to specify filename
	position as in dired-guess-shell-alist-user.  If you are
	modifying code to call (especially) dired-dd-shell-command2,
	change "%s" to "*".  dired-dd-shell-command2 does not support
	"%s" anymore as marker of filename position.  Very sorry.

	*** Spinout directory now contains a perl script "jcol.pl",
	which is Japanized version of `col' command to post-processing
	of "man -mandoc" output.  dired-dd-b3-menu.el assumes the script.

	*** Cleanup.

* Version 0.9.1.14

	*** Bug fix on dired-dd-b3-menu.el by courtesy of
	Yuji Yamano <yyamano@kt.rim.or.jp>.
	Now byte-compilation never fails even if no $LANG is set.

	*** Slight cleanup of Makefile.

* Version 0.9.1.13

	*** BUG fix on dired-dd-insert-fname.el.  See ChangeLog.

* Version 0.9.1.12

	*** Slight fix.  ARGLIST handed to functions registered in variable
	dired-dd-non-dired-drop-handlers format is changed.  Current format
	is:
		(FILENAME-LIST WINDOW MODIFIERS POINT)

	If the parameters included in the ARGLIST is not enough,
	you can also use variables such as modifiers, event, start-window
	etc., which are defined in upper functions.

	*** dired-dd-insert-file.el is included. Another sample of 
	`dired-dd-non-dired-drop-handler'.  Inserts file content at
	the dropped point by S-drag-mouse-2.  Buffer mode is not checked,
	so that file(s) can be drop-inserted into any non-dired buffer.

	*** dired-dd-insert-fname.el: Another non-dired-buffer-drop handler.
	Insert filename by Drag-and-drop in any non-dired-buffer.
	Supports:	
		C-drag-mouse-2: insert plain filename(s)
		M-drag-mouse-2: insert fullpath name(s)

* Version 0.9.1.11

	*** An generic non-dired target buffer (window) handlers support.
	User can define a prefered handler function for a non-dired target
	buffer.
	
	The Handler functions can be registered in a new
	variable dired-dd-non-dired-drop-handlers.

	An example of the handler function is enclosed
	is dired-dd-mew.el, which enables drag-and-drop attachment file
	into "attachments" field into Mew's draft buffer.

	See doc string for dired-dd-non-dired-drop-handlers for detail.

* Version 0.9.1.10

      *** Double clicking mouse button 1 provides a generic file opening
        facility (not only for find-file anymore).
	Now you don't have to worry about whether the file should be
	opend with emacs, or external commands (Just like in Macintosh, or
	Windows)!:

	* [double-mouse-1] (dired-dd-find-file-or-exec):
	Now [double-mouse-1] eventually calls for dired-dd-find-file-or-exec,
	which examines related command for marked files first, then, if
	command is found, branch to dired-dd-exec-command-directly, otherwise
	to dired-dd-find-marked-files (this is new too) to just find the
	marked file.

      *** A new variable dired-dd-find-multiple-file to force
	double-mouse-1 (dired-dd-find-file-or-exec) to find-file
	(opeing-with-emacs) all the marked files/directories (default:
	nil).

      *** Further, one spinout function, which is unbound by default:

	The dired-find-file-other-frame can be called from keyboard.
	Possible ~/.emacs settings (not well tested):

	  (define-key dired-mode-map "\e\C-o" 'dired-find-file-other-frame)
	  (autoload 'dired-find-file-other-frame "dired-dd" nil t)

* Version 0.9.1.9

	** Another bunch of small fixes.
	** Fixed bug on drop onto root window (multiple marked directories
	were not correctly opened).
	** Fixed bug in async command execution (M-mouse-2) deep down in
	recursive dired listing (eg. with adding `ls' listing flag `R' by C-u s).

* Version 0.9.1.8

	** Minor fixes.

* Version 0.9.1.7

	** Supported drop objects on root window:
	   file or directory is opend with new frame.
	** New variable dired-dd-iconify-control-on-root-drop:
	   iconify or deiconify new frame in Emacs-20.xx upon root window drop.
	** Supported M-drag-mouse-1 to flag files with `D'.
	** "wrong-type-argument integerp nil" error rarely occurs in mule-2.3 fixed.
	** Minor fixes.

* Version 0.9.1.6

	** Now dired-dd is distributed under GPL (version 2) from
	this version 0.9.1.6.

	** spinout/str-arg.el is added.  get-string-arg-and-call works like
	C-u C-x C-f (dired-x-find-file) RET, but works also for
	non-filename and any commands which takes string as first argument.

* Version 0.9.1.5

	** Fixed the bug that mark (at BOL of dired buffer) is not
	retained in inter-frame drag & drop.

	** Now menu raised by mouse button 3 has `Launch Terminal'
	entry at the top.  It fires up xterm or kterm (determined
	automatically depending upon LANG environment variable)
	asynchronously with `cd'ing current dired buffer's default
	(current) directory.

	** spinout/locate-dired.el: Now window locate-dired uses
	current window.  If older version's behavior is favored, set
	variable locate-dired-use-other-window to t.

	** A short file INSTALL describing installation knowhow added.

* Version 0.9.1.4

	** Small fix.  Potential bug of infinite loop in loading
	dired-dd (order of provide feature, and run-hooks for
	dired-dd-load-hook).  Perhaps it has been ok in older
	versions, if user does not have (require 'dired-dd) in
	dired-dd-load-hook functions.

* Version 0.9.1.3

	** M-mouse-2 (dired-dd-exec-command-directly) executes
	shell-command asynchronously.  Now the same command can be
	executed from the menu raised by drag-mouse-2.
	
	** Copy recursive entry in the two menus.

	** dired-dd-default-symlink-method is renamed to
	dired-dd-default-link-method, and is not referred anymore.
	Please modify your ~/.emacs if required.  Sorry.

	** Refined pointer animation by dired-dd-version.
	dired-dd-version just display version # without the animation if
	your display or network is too slow.

	** Copying notice.  See the top section of dired-dd.el, e.g.

	** BUG Fixes.

	** spinout/locate-dired: Now output buffer looks like dired buffer
	closely evermore.

	** New command (C-x4L: just suggested)
	(locate-dired-other-frame) in spinout/locate-dired.el

	** archie.el-v3.0.diff.gz:
	Two new commands:
	    o (archie-dired-other-window)
	    F (archie-dired-other-frame) (calls other-win if on non X)

* Version 0.0.0.8

	** First publicly distributed version. For older changes, see
	attached ChangeLog.
