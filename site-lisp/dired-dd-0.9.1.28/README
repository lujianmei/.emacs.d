Refer to INSTALL for brief infomation on installing and loading
dired-dd, and dired-dd.info for more detailed informations.
dired-dd can be opened in `info mode' with `I' command in ordinary
dired buffer.

Currently core part of dired-dd is composed of dired-dd.el and
dired-dd-b3-menu.el.

To support some drag-and-drop operations into non-dired buffer,
some small (experimental or sample) programs are included:

  dired-dd-mew.el: for drag-drop MIME attachment file into Mew's draft buffer.
  dired-dd-insert-file.el: for drag-drop file(s) into non-dired buffer.
  dired-dd-insert-fname.el: for drag-drop filename(s) into non-dired buffer.



From version 0.9.1.6, dired-dd is distributed under GPL (version 2)

The older versions might include different copying notice (even if I believe
they were also `Free Software' as well), but forget all about those obsolete
versions.

I take GPL because I think it is the best way to distribute my work on elisp
for `free', and express my respect to all the emacs related works ever
been achieved.

The files under `spinout' directory may not all have the GPL copying notice
in order to save storage space, but take them as they were protected
under GPL.
