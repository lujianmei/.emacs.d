<P>
<STRONG>Dired-dd</STRONG> (aka <STRONG>Dired-DragDrop</STRONG>)
is a minor mode enabling mouse interface 
for <CODE>dired</CODE> / <CODE>dired-x</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
It provides facilities in <CODE>dired</CODE>:<BR>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mark files / directories in a dired buffer (mouse-1 drag)
<LI>

Drag files / directories and drop into dired buffer, for copy/move/link etc. (mouse-2 drag)
<LI>

Open file (or execute defined function) by dragging into non-dired buffer, or via menu (mouse-2 drag)
<LI>

Execute external command related to file extension (M-mouse-2 click or double-click mouse-1)
<LI>

Raise a miscellaneous file handling menu (mouse-3 click)
<LI>

Caveat: No inter-application drag and drop supported yet (or forever ?)
<LI>

Caveat: Works only on FSF emacs (19.28, 19.34, 20.2, 20.3) and mule (2.3, 3.0, 4.0), but not on XEmacs.
</UL>

<P>
wherein,<BR>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Drop target window may exist in different emacs's frame
(<EM>inter-frame</EM> drag &#38; drop supported).
<LI>

Surprisingly enough, <CODE>ange-ftp</CODE> works -- It means that you can
<STRONG>FTP</STRONG> via drag drop (except <TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> in menu entry).
<LI>

<CODE>find-dired, find-grep-dired, locate-dired</CODE> or all other dired-related-stuff-compatible
</UL>

<P>
<BR>
<CODE>locate-dired</CODE> can be located in <TT>`spinout'</TT> directory of
dired-dd distribution.  The <TT>`spinout'</TT> directory contains other
assorted stuffs including a patch for <TT>`archie.el'</TT>, elisp codes for
URL-to-ange-ftp conversion, Netscape bookmark stealer, and others that
work well with <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Now <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> is distributed under GPL (version 2). See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC8">COPYING</A>.

<P>
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE> was written and tested on mule-2.3 (both of official
emacs-19.28, and unofficial emacs-19.34 based versions) and emacs-20.2
and 20.3.  It works fine on the 19.x and 20.x emacsen, but some
behaviours (eg. menu appearance) are not exactly the same.  Emacs-18
(Nemacs) is not supported at all.  Perhaps <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> won't work in
XEmacs, in which <CODE>dired</CODE> is totally different from FSF emacsen.  It
has not been tested on Windows version of emacs / mule.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE> uses <CODE>dired-x</CODE> features intensively and
extensively.  See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC4">Installing <CODE>dired-dd</CODE></A> for minimum setup of
<CODE>dired-x</CODE> just for <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, or further refer to
<CODE>dired-x</CODE> info file (<KBD>M-x info RET</KBD> and search for
<TT>`Dired-X'</TT>) for datailed information on setup and customization of
<CODE>dired-x</CODE>.  <CODE>dired-x</CODE> is included in a standard emacs
distribution, so you shouldn't have to FTP it.

<P>
Currently, <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> is composed of
<TT>`dired-dd.el'</TT> and <TT>`dired-dd-b3-menu.el'</TT>.
Byte-compile these two files
and copy derived
<TT>`dired-dd.elc'</TT> and<BR>
<TT>`dired-dd-b3-menu.elc'</TT>
into your emacs's load path<BR>
(<TT>`/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/'</TT>, <TT>`~/elisp'</TT> or wherever appropriate).
Byte-compiling of <TT>`dired-dd.el'</TT> and <TT>`dired-dd-b3-menu.el'</TT> is
strongly recommended.

</P>
<P>
This two-step file installation can be done by attached <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
In this <TT>`Makefile'</TT>, the default <CODE>emacs</CODE> and <CODE>elispdir</CODE>
are defined as:

</P>

<PRE>
emacs=/usr/local/emacs-20.2/bin/emacs
elispdir=~/elisp
</PRE>

<P>
Thus, if your emacs is <TT>`/gnu/bin/emacs'</TT> and your
lisp directory is <TT>`/gnu/lib/emacs/site-lisp'</TT>,
invoke <TT>`make'</TT> with overriding the defaults above:

</P>

<PRE>
$ make emacs=/gnu/bin/emacs compile
$ make emacs=/gnu/bin/emacs install elispdir=/gnu/lib/emacs/site-lisp
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC6">Modifying your <TT>`~/.emacs'</TT></A></H3>

<P>
Include add-hook codes below in your <TT>`~/.emacs'</TT>:

      (if window-system (require 'dired-dd)))))
</PRE>

<P>
In dired-load-hook, you can customize various
features including <CODE>dired-x</CODE>
(see section `Installation' in <CITE>dired-x info</CITE>).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> is implemented as a minor mode for <CODE>dired-mode</CODE>.
If you do not want to turn on <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> automatically
upon entering <CODE>dired-mode</CODE>, remove "<CODE>;;</CODE>" before
<CODE>(setq dired-dd-mode-as-default nil)</CODE> in the example above.

</P>
<P>
If you set <CODE>dired-dd-mode-as-default</CODE> to nil, you have to
turn on <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> with manual operation
(see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC9">Dired-dd minor mode</A>).

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC7">Printing Info (optional)</A></H3>

<P>
PostScript formatted version of this info is included under the
distribution directory.  If you want hardcopy, issue shell
command such as <CODE>lpr -Pps dired-dd.ps</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Of course, <TT>`dired-dd.info'</TT>, and perhaps <TT>`dired-dd_toc.html'</TT>
and <TT>`dired-dd.html'</TT> can be found in the same directory.  Use your
favorite WWW browser to read the html version.  For
<TT>`dired-dd.info'</TT>, use <CODE>dired</CODE> <TT>`I'</TT> command, or
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE> menu raised by <KBD>mouse-3</KBD> (or install it in your info
directory).

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`dired-dd.ps'</TT> was formatted with <TT>`dvi2ps'</TT> as can be seen
in the <TT>`Makefile'</TT>, with PostScript version of <TT>`cm'</TT> fonts.  If
you do not have PostScript <TT>`cm'</TT> fonts, or want to print it with
genuine <TT>`pk'</TT> fonts for some reason, run <TT>`texi2dvi'</TT> locally.
Texinfo version used for drafting this info seems to be 2.145, according
to <TT>`texi2dvi'</TT> output (maybe it is old ?).

<P>
Since version 0.9.1.6, <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> is distributed under GPL (version 2).

</P>
<P>
The older versions might include different copying notice (even if I believe
they were also `Free Software' as well), but forget all about those obsolete
versions.

</P>
<P>
I take GPL because I think it is the best way to distribute my work on elisp
for `free', and express my respect to all the emacs related works ever
been achieved.

</P>
<P>
The files under `spinout' directory may not all have the GPL copying notice
in order to save storage space, but consider them protected
under GPL as well.

</P>
<P>
I cite the copying notice at the top of this texi/info file hereunder,
for it may not be seen via info browser.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> is implemented as a normal minor mode for
<CODE>dired-mode</CODE>.  <KBD>M-x dired-dd-mode RET</KBD> toggles on / off state
<CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE>.  While <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> is turned on, string
"DragDrop" appears in modeline.

</P>
<P>
Further, issuing command <KBD>C-u M-x dired-dd-mode RET</KBD>
(with positive numeric argument) forces to turn
on <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE>, while <KBD>M- - M-x dired-dd-mode RET</KBD>
(with negative numeric argument) turns it off.

</P>
<P>
You will notice that some of the mouse commands, for example
<KBD>M-drag-mouse-1</KBD> <CODE>(mouse-drag-secondary)</CODE>, are totally disabled
in <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE>.  Turn off <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> manually, if you
want to use such commands on <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer.

</P>
<P>
Variable <CODE>dired-dd-mode-as-default</CODE> controls whether
<CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> is automatically enabled or not (see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC29">Turning on / off <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> as default minor mode</A>) upon entering <CODE>dired-mode</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
It is possible to turn on <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> within a non-<CODE>dired</CODE>
buffer, but that is totally useless.

<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>

</P>
<P>
Dragging Mouse button 1 marks files or directories with <CODE>*</CODE>.  This
mouse command is almost compatible to ordinary <CODE>dired</CODE> command
<KBD>m</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
Double click of mouse Button 1 <EM>opens</EM> file(s) or directory(s)
objects by an external application (shell command) or emacs.  The
<EM>opening</EM> method is automatically selected.  The criteria for the
<EM>opening</EM> method selection is whether any shell command is
registered for the <EM>extension</EM> part of the file name of the
objects.

</P>
<P>
The core part of the dragging is handled by function
<CODE>dired-dd-drag-region</CODE>, which is bound to <KBD>down-mouse-1</KBD>.
<KBD>double-mouse-1</KBD> eventually executes
<CODE>dired-dd-find-file-or-exec</CODE>.

</P>

<P>
Caveat:<BR>
In <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, a single function may have multiple mouse bindings
for some technical reason.  So, hereafter in this document, the
convention of normal emacs info, in which user command is often
designated such as

</P>

<PRE>
M-down-mouse-1 (mouse-drag-secondary)

<P>
may not be followed in relevant sections below.

<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>

</P>
<P>
Dragging region by mouse button 1 marks or unmarks file(s) or directory(s)
with a mark <CODE>*</CODE> (toggles marking status).
Moving the mouse horizontally a bit marks or unmarks a single file.
Dragged region is copied to the kill ring as a side effect.
Secondary selection handling with <KBD>M-mouse-1</KBD> and <KBD>M-mouse-2</KBD>
is totally disabled.

</P>
<P>
The mark <CODE>*</CODE> put by dragging of mouse button 1 is identical to the
normal mark <CODE>*</CODE> put by normal <CODE>dired</CODE> keyboard command
(e.g. <KBD>m</KBD> <CODE>(dired-mark)</CODE>).  All of the normal <CODE>dired</CODE>
keyboard commands, and menu bar or popup menu (in emacs-20.xx) commands
can properly interpret the mark <CODE>*</CODE> put by Mouse Button 1.  All of
the commands invoked by mouse buttons 2 and 3 work on files and/or
directories marked with this mark <CODE>*</CODE> (if any marked file exists).

</P>
<P>
Pressing <KBD>Meta</KBD> key while dragging with mouse button 1 <EM>flags</EM>
files or directories with <CODE>D</CODE> (delete) flag instead of mark
<CODE>*</CODE>.  You can delete the files flagged with <CODE>D</CODE> by hitting
<KBD>x</KBD> <CODE>(dired-do-flagged-delete)</CODE>.  The only menu entry that
works on <CODE>D</CODE> flagged files is <TT>`Delete Flagged'</TT> entry found in
the menu raised by mouse button 3, which is equivalent to <KBD>x</KBD>
<CODE>(dired-do-flagged-delete)</CODE>.  The other commands invoked from mouse
buttons 2 and 3 do not affect <CODE>D</CODE> <EM>flagged</EM> files, but
<CODE>*</CODE> <EM>marked</EM> files.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

</P>
<P>
Double clicking mouse button 1 provides a generic file <EM>opening</EM>
facility.  The file is opend with an external application (shell
command) predefined in association with the <EM>extension</EM> part of the
file name, or if no such application is defined, <KBD>double-mouse-1</KBD>
falls back to a mere file opening operation using emacs buffer.

</P>
<P>
The opening target is marked with <CODE>*</CODE>, or the double-
clicked file (or directory) if no file (or directory) is marked
in the <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> buffer.

</P>
<P>
<KBD>Double-mouse-1</KBD> eventually calls a function
<CODE>dired-dd-find-file-or-exec</CODE>.  This function first tries to invoke
a shell command (application) relevant to the extension of the file name
asynchronously.  If it can't find such a shell command, the function
<CODE>dired-dd-find-file-or-exec</CODE> just opens marked (or clicked) file or
directory using the selected window displaying the current <CODE>dired</CODE>
buffer.

</P>
<P>
The relationship between filename extensions and their respective
handling command (application) should be stored in a <CODE>dired-x</CODE>
variable <CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE> (or
<CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-default</CODE>).  This feature relies on
<CODE>dired-x</CODE>.  <KBD>C-h v dired-guess-shell-alist-user RET</KBD> shows you
how to combine a command to a certain file extension (<TT>`*.jpeg'</TT> =&#62;
execute <TT>`xv'</TT>, etc), and the current relationship setup in the
variable.  See section `Shell Command Guessing' in <CITE>dired-x info</CITE>.

</P>
<P>
Rough and ready interactive command <CODE>dired-dd-register-shell-alist</CODE>
is provided to add entry in <CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>.
However, the command <CODE>dired-dd-register-shell-alist</CODE> is not
automatically called when there is no shell command is registered in
<CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>.  Further, no automatic saving
facility (for <CODE>custom-file</CODE>) is provided in current
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.  Adding setup codes for
<CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE> in your <TT>`~/.emacs'</TT> is the most
handy and safe way to support new shell command for certain file
extension.

</P>
<P>
The invoked shell command output is collected in buffer <TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT>.
All the processes invoked by <CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE> share
this buffer.  Until all the processes sharing the buffer exit,
string `run' is shown in the mode line of the buffer <TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
After all the processes have exited, the mode line shows `exit'.  The
buffer <TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT> exists just for collecting stdout/stderr
output from the invoked command(s).  Killing the buffer
<TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT> does no harm (perhaps) to invoked command(s).  No
fancy job control interface is implemented.

</P>
<P>
As described above, double clicking mouse button 1 automatically selects
file <EM>opening</EM> method, which works fine in most cases.  However, no
matter how your <CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE> definition is
designed carefully, there should be such situation that you have to
force either opening-by-emacs or open-by-external-application.

</P>
<P>
For instance, think about the case you have registered a shell script to
pass a marked HTML file to Netscape in
<CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>, but you have to edit it in
HTML-helper mode in emacs.

</P>
<P>
Use <KBD>mouse-2</KBD> (<CODE>dired-dd-find-file</CODE>) to force opening a file
(or directory) with emacs, or <KBD>M-mouse-2</KBD>
(<CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE>) to force execution of the
registered command explicitly (see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC19">Click (Single)</A>).

Mouse button 2 is the most important part of <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.  It
handles <EM>Drag and Drop</EM>.  Further, single clicking of Mouse button
2 opens files / directories, as well as executes command related to the
file extension.

</P>
<P>
Users are strongly advised to create a directory or two accommodating
dummy files to try drag-and-drop operations and features of
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.  There is "NO WARRANTY" for <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC8">COPYING</A>).

</P>
<P>
Function <CODE>dired-dd-drag-drop</CODE> takes charge in <EM>Drag and Drop</EM>
part of mouse button 2, and is bound to multiple mouse events such

<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC15">Drag-and-drop object and target</A></H3>

<P>
With mouse button 2, you can drag marked (or on point) files or
directories, and drop them somewhere.  You can drop the object into
another <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer, or into directory line in the same
<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer.  All of these drop targets are <TT>`directory'</TT>
objects.

</P>
<P>
A `drop target' may be not only a `directory object', but also a
`non-directory object'.  For example, see what happens when you drop a
file or directory into non-<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer.

</P>
<P>
The target <CODE>dired</CODE> or non-<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer, or target directory
line in a <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer can be located anywhere in emacs.  For
example, `source' <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer and target <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer may
be identical. Or, target <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer, or target directory line
may be displayed in a window different from the `source' <CODE>dired</CODE>
window.  The target <CODE>dired</CODE> window can be accommodated in a
different emacs frame.

</P>
<P>
On drag and drop into a directory object (a <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer or
directory line in a <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer), a menu is popped up to ask
file operation method for the drag drop.  The menu also includes several
entries which are thought to be convenient but may not be relevant
directly to drag and drop operation.

</P>
<P>
The job selected from the popup menu is immediately executed (copy,
move, link etc.)  if the target is explicit, while minibuffer prompt is
raised if the target (normally it is a directory) is ambiguous.

</P>
<P>
The same menu is popped upon horizontal drag.  This means that you made
drag &#38; drop into the same directory, if the dragged object is file(s).
In this case, the destination of copy/move/link etc. is asked by
minibuffer interface.

</P>
<P>
If the horizontally dragged object is a directory, note that the target
directory is not the same as the default directory of the <CODE>dired</CODE>
buffer (refer to subsection "Where is my file ?" below).

</P>
<P>
Also See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC22">The Popup Menu</A> for the menu raised by mouse button 2.

<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC16">Non-<CODE>dired</CODE> targets.</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>

</P>
<P>
Drag and drop into non-directory object (other non-<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer),
the file or directory object is just opened using the window into which
it dropped (or defined function is executed. See below).  This is an
emulation of a drag and drop operation, which can be commonly found in
various file managers and editing applications (eg. <TT>`Word'</TT> and
<TT>`Explorer'</TT>, <CODE>Offix</CODE> <TT>`Files'</TT> and <TT>`Editor'</TT> or
<TT>`Trash'</TT> and so on).

</P>
<P>
The behaviour of on drag-and-dropping files into non-directory object
(other non-<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer) can be customized with variable
<CODE>dired-dd-non-dired-drop-handlers</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC34">Customizing behavior on dropping into non-dired buffer</A> for detailed informations.

</P>
<P>
On dropping onto non-<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer located in another frame, files
or directories are opened using multiple windows.

</P>
<P>
Further, from version 0.9.1.7, the object can be dropped on root window.
Before 0.9.1.7, dropping object on root window was treated with message
"No emacs frame over there", but now the object (file or directory) is
opened by function <CODE>find-file-other-frame</CODE>.  The dropped file or
directory is opened using an independent frame, which is newly created,
or just raised (this behaviour may differ depending upon the window
manager in use) if it already exists.  If variable
<CODE>dired-dd-iconify-control-on-root-drop</CODE> (default: nil) is non-nil,
the relevant frame is iconified or deiconified depending on its iconic
status.  This iconify control may not work nicely (or be totally
ignored) in some version of emacs, or with some window manager.

</P>
<P>
As a handler routine for the dropping onto non-<CODE>dired</CODE> target, an
emacs command (function) <CODE>dired-find-file-other-frame</CODE> is provided.
This emacs command can be called from keyboard.  Possible settings (not
well tested) in <TT>`./emacs'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
  (define-key dired-mode-map "\e\C-o" 'dired-find-file-other-frame)
  (autoload 'dired-find-file-other-frame "dired-dd" nil t)
</PRE>

<P>
Unfortunately, inter-application drag-and-drop is not supported yet (or
forever) in <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.  It seems that there are known some emacsen
which can handle inter-application drag-and-drop, but the authour may be
too busy to support them as a <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> platform, or build
primitive functions for inter-application drag-and-drop disabled normal
emacs.

<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC17">Quick drag and drop with modifier keys</A></H3>

<P>
Dragging with <KBD>Control/Meta/Shift</KBD> key is supported.  These modifier
keys are detected at the very timing of releasing mouse button (as in
<TT>`XV'</TT>'s Visual Schunauzer).  Thus, in order to select file operation
method, you may start drag with <KBD>down-mouse-2</KBD>, then press
<KBD>Control/Meta/Shift</KBD> before releasing it, even if you rebind
<KBD>C-/M-/S-down-mouse-2</KBD> to other functions.

</P>
<P>
Each modifier specifies file (or directory) operation for the current
drag and drop as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`<KBD>Control</KBD>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<SAMP>`C'</SAMP>opy file
<DT><SAMP>`<KBD>Meta</KBD>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<SAMP>`M'</SAMP>ove (rename) file
<DT><SAMP>`<KBD>Shift</KBD>'</SAMP>
<DD>
(maybe <SAMP>`S'</SAMP>ymbolic ?) Link file
</DL>

<P>
In linking file / directory with <KBD>Shift</KBD> modifier, the link method
is determined by variable <CODE>dired-dd-default-link-method</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC33">File linking method</A>).

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC18">Where is my file ?</A></H3>

<P>
Be carefull when you drop a file or directory into in a <CODE>dired</CODE>
buffer.  If a file or directory is dropped into an ordinary file line,
into the first header line, or into <TT>`.'</TT> line, it is
copied/moved/linked into the directory corresponding to the target
<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer's default directory as you may expect.  However,
dropping a file or directory into a directory line in a <CODE>dired</CODE>
buffer means that you selected the directory (line) as the destination
directory.  This is rational feature of <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, but the file or
directory may be copied/moved/linked to unintended place due to this
feature, if you do not care much about the target line.  Especially when
you drop with the modifier keys, no menu is raised, nor destination is
displayed in the echo area of emacs, so please pay a special attention
on drop-target when you quick-drop with the modifier key.

Opens a file (or directory) using other window.  Always only the clicked

(or directory) existed in the <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer.<BR>

From version 0.9.1.10, an alternative function (emacs command)
<CODE>dired-dd-find-marked-files</CODE> is provided is implemented. This
function can alternatively be bound to, for example, <CODE>C-S-mouse-2</CODE>
with including a line


<PRE>
(define-key dired-dd-mode-map [C-S-mouse-2] 'dired-dd-find-marked-files)
</PRE>

(I think this binding is not what you want in most situations, though).<BR>

<LI>

<KBD>M-mouse-2</KBD> (<CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE>)<BR>

<KBD>M-mouse-2</KBD> executes a shell command related the file extension.
The function <CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE> bound to this mouse
event asynchronously invokes a shell command (application) related to
the filename extension of the marked or clicked file (or directory).
Command output is collected in buffer <TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT>.  All the
process invoked by <CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE> shares this
buffer.  Until all the process sharing the buffer are terminated, string
`run' is shown in mode line of the buffer <TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT>.

<BR>
After all the process are exited, the mode line will show `exit'.  The
buffer <TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT> exists just for collect stdout/stderr
output from the invoked command.  Killing the buffer
<TT>`*dired-dd-proc*'</TT> does no harm (perhaps) for invoked command.  No
fancy job control interface is implemented.

<BR>
As for the relationship between the filename extension and the related
shell command, See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC12">Double click</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>

</P>

<P>
Mouse Button 3 raises a menu facilitating miscellaneous file operations.
This menu features various shell commands which are not available
directly from original <CODE>dired</CODE>'s menu-bar, or popup menu.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC21">Click (Single)</A></H2>

<P>
Clicking mouse Button 3 raises a full menu (not so `full' as
<CODE>dired</CODE> menu bar, but good enough for daily use, I suppose) to ask
a handling method (delete/copy/move... etc) for marked (or on point)
files delete/copy/move... etc.

</P>
<P>
Probably at the time of public release of <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, various of
shell commands will be bound which are not available direct from
original <CODE>dired</CODE> menu bar or key binding.  The menu raised by mouse
button 3 can be customized (see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC39">Menu raised by Button 3</A>).

</P>
<P>
Consider the default menu raised by mouse button 3 as just a
customizable file operation menu.  Also See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC22">The Popup Menu</A> for the
menu raised by mouse button 3.

</P>
<P>
In Emacs-19.xx, <KBD>S-mouse-3</KBD> raises the original <CODE>dired</CODE>
menu-bar as popup menu, which is a full-featured one.  You can use
<KBD>C-mouse-3</KBD> menu as it is in emacs-20.

<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC23"><TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> entry</A></H2>

<P>
Most of the entries in the menu raised by <KBD>mouse-2</KBD> call ordinary
<CODE>dired</CODE> commands having <CODE>dired-</CODE> or <CODE>dired-do-</CODE> prefix in
their function name.  Thus, almost all of these `dired-compatible'
commands will work almost the same as you expect from normal
<CODE>dired</CODE> operations.  At the same time, as a matter of course, the
same limitation of the <CODE>dired</CODE> command is also applied: For
example, neither recursive copy of directory tree, nor moving directory
tree across different file systems is possible.

</P>
<P>
One exception is <TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> entry (new from version 0.9) in
the menu raised by <KBD>mouse-2</KBD> and <KBD>mouse-3</KBD>.  This menu entry is
bound to functions <TT>`dired-dd-copy-recursive'</TT> (in case of
<KBD>mouse-2</KBD>), and <TT>`dired-dd-do-copy-recursive'</TT> (in case of
<KBD>mouse-3</KBD>).

</P>
<P>
In the <TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> facility,
control returns to emacs faster than
normal C (<TT>`dired-do-copy'</TT>) or <TT>`"Copy"'</TT> menu item, so it has
a merit to use even for plain files (not for directory tree),
especially when they are huge in size.

</P>
<P>
Downside of the <TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> facility is 
that the target dired buffer may not be updated correctly.
Try hitting key <KBD>g</KBD> (<TT>`revert-buffer'</TT>)
after <TT>`"Copy Recursive"'</TT> to update the target <TT>`dired'</TT> buffer.

</P>
<P>
These <TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> functions eventually call a
sub-shell command defined in a variable
<CODE>dired-dd-copy-recursive-command</CODE>, whose default value is <SAMP>`cp
-a'</SAMP>, assuming it being GNU <TT>`cp'</TT> command.

</P>
<P>
If you do not have <TT>`cp'</TT> command which can be invoked as <TT>`cp -a
file targetdir'</TT>, install GNU fileutil, or write an equivalent script
using <TT>`tar'</TT>, <TT>`cpio'</TT> etc.

</P>
<P>
The menu entry <TT>`Copy Recursive'</TT> can copy files / directories fast
across different file systems recursively, but do not work over FTP
directory.

</P>
<P>
Command <CODE>dired-dd-do-copy-recursive-regexp</CODE> is also provided in
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.  The command <CODE>dired-dd-do-copy-recursive</CODE>, as well
as <CODE>dired-dd-do-copy-recursive-regexp</CODE> can be bound to a key
similarly as in the case of standard <CODE>dired-do-xxx</CODE>, or
<CODE>dired-do-xxx-regexp</CODE> commands in <CODE>dired</CODE>, for example:

</P>

<PRE>
(define-key dired-dd-mode-map "\eC" 'dired-dd-do-copy-recursive)
(define-key dired-dd-mode-map "%c" 'dired-dd-do-copy-recursive-regexp)
</PRE>

<P>
or

<PRE>
(define-key dired-dd-mode-map "%R" 'dired-dd-do-copy-recursive-regexp)
</PRE>

<P>
These key bindings are not defined as a default in <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>
because I do not think they are good ones.  Choose any preferred key
bindings if you want to use these commands from keyboard as well.

</P>
<P>
<TT>`Move Recursive'</TT> is not supported in <CODE>dire-dd</CODE> yet.  If you do
not like to keep old directory after you have <TT>`copied recursive'</TT>,
just erase it (the menu raised by <KBD>mouse-3</KBD> has <TT>`Delete
Recursive'</TT>).

</P>
<P>
The menu raised by <KBD>mouse-3</KBD> has some more `dired-incompatible'
commands.  They are all conceived to provide convenience, but the
in-compatibleness may irritate users. Just consider them as an example
of customizable menu entry (see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC39">Menu raised by Button 3</A>).

<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC24"><TT>`Exec Related CMD'</TT> entry</A></H2>

From version 0.9.1.3, <TT>`Exec Related CMD'</TT> entry in mouse-2 menu
invokes shell command asynchronously.  This menu item is compatible to
<KBD>M-mouse-2</KBD> (<CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC19">Click (Single)</A>.

<P>
From version 0.9.1.5, <TT>`Launch a Terminal'</TT> entry is the top item in
the menu raised by mouse-3 no matter how the real emacs user hates it
(or not). The <TT>`Refresh Listing'</TT> entry is moved down to the bottom
accordingly.

</P>
<P>
This menu item runs shell command stored in variable
<CODE>dired-dd-terminal-command</CODE>, whose default value is <TT>`xterm'</TT>,
or probably <TT>`kterm'</TT> depending upon environment variable
<TT>`LANG'</TT>. Set your favorite terminal emulator name in
<CODE>dired-dd-terminal-command</CODE>.  Options may be included in
<CODE>dired-dd-terminal-command</CODE>, for example:

</P>

<P>
As in the case of <CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>,
<CODE>dired-dd-terminal-command</CODE> may include <CODE>exec</CODE> at the top of
its string value (e.g. <CODE>"exec rxvt -fn vga"</CODE> for the example above)

The handler function can assume that current window/buffer is already
switched to the target of the relevant drag-and-drop when it is called.
It is responsibility of the handler function to examine whether the
current window/buffer is suitable for its own job.  The examination
should be strict as possible, because it is not predictable that the
user registers what sort of handler function in what order.

</P>
<P>
It may not be such a good idea to try to customize the menu raised by
Button 2.  Currently variable <CODE>dired-dd-b2-menu</CODE>, and its handler
routine are very nasty.  Hack the source code, if you really want to
modify <KBD>mouse-2</KBD> menu, but I might change the structure of
<CODE>dired-dd-b2-menu</CODE> (to normal keymap ?) totally in future version.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC39">Menu raised by Button 3</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can customize the menu raised by button 3 with modifying variable
<CODE>dired-dd-b3-keymap</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The variable <CODE>dired-dd-b3-keymap</CODE> is structured as a emacs keymap,
so you can use <CODE>define-key</CODE> / <CODE>define-key-after</CODE> to customize
the menu as normal keymap.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, the use of keymap is expanded (which may be an
`abuse').  You can define not only a normal menu keymap entry:

</P>

<PRE>
   (define-key-after (lookup-key dired-dd-b3-keymap [file])
     [open2] '("Open2" . find-file) 'o-other-win)
</PRE>

<P>
but also even an eval'able form (<CODE>'(dired-view-file)</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
   (define-key-after (lookup-key dired-dd-b3-keymap [file])
     [view2] '("View2" . (dired-view-file)) 'o-other-win)
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the second example above contains a non-command object as
`definition' (<CODE>'(dired-view-file)</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, if a key definition in the <CODE>dired-dd-b3-keymap</CODE>
is a symbol (<CODE>'find-file</CODE>, in the first example above), the symbol
is called as command with passing marked filename(s) as a 1st argument
(repeatedly), while if the key definition is not a symbol (sexp
<CODE>'(dired-view-file)</CODE>, in the second example above), it is just
evaluated once.

</P>
<P>
Both the bindings above can only be handled by special function
<CODE>dired-dd-x-popup-menu-out-of-keymap</CODE> (and its upper function),
which acts similarly to <CODE>x-popup-menu</CODE> when <CODE>x-popup-menu</CODE> is
fed with non-keymap list as its 2nd argment.

</P>
<P>
Of course, you can undefine the unnecessary menu entry:<BR>

</P>

<PRE>
(define-key dired-dd-b3-keymap [arc lha-x] 'undefined)
(define-key dired-dd-b3-keymap [arc lha-v] 'undefined)
</PRE>

<P>
Updated <CODE>dired-dd-b3-keymap</CODE> can be inspected by evaluating

</P>

<PRE>
(x-popup-menu t dired-dd-b3-keymap)
</PRE>

<P>
or

<PRE>
(dired-dd-x-popup-menu-out-of-keymap t dired-dd-b3-keymap)

</P>
<P>
Do not bind the variable <CODE>dired-dd-b3-keymap</CODE> directly to

It is advisable to use <CODE>dired-dd-load-hook</CODE> to change mouse (key)

This chapter deals with miscellaneous tips on using <TT>`dired-dd'</TT>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="dired-dd_toc.html#TOC42">Using dired-dd in multiple window / frame environment</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>

</P>
<P>
<EM>dired-dd</EM> is very useful when you are browsing through directory
trees.  I know that keyboard is faster than bothering to move over to
mouse, but sometimes I feel lazy and wish I could use mouse for browsing
through file system.

</P>
<P>
On using <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>, my recommendation is to split an emacs frame
into several windows horizontally and/or vertically, or further into
several frames, select one of them as browsing window (frame), and the
other for <CODE>dired</CODE> window (frame).  And, open file with drag and
drop from <CODE>dired</CODE> window (frame) to browsing window (frame).

</P>
<P>
I prefer to use a window manager, but you can use emacs even without
window manager at all.  Once I tried starting only emacs from .xinitrc
on a 1600x1200 sized <CODE>X</CODE>'s root window without any window manager,
and split it up to 5 to 6 windows for <CODE>dired</CODE> and browsing buffers.
In such situation, <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> works very nicely; <TT>`mldrag.el'</TT>
helped me a good deal in adjusting window configurations, and with
<TT>`windows.el'</TT>, I could even handle multiple frames without window
manager (see section <A HREF="dired-dd.html#SEC43">Other programs going well with dired-dd</A>) at all.

</P>
<P>
I found that it is convenient if a command to kill or bury buffer
is bound to certain mouse event when you are
browsing through many files and directories.  Or,
sometimes after root-drop, you may want to delete many frames, and
<CODE>C-x 5 0</CODE> is really annoying if there are too may frames to be killed.

</P>
<P>
Setting variable
<CODE>dired-dd-use-modeline-binding-global</CODE> to non-nil enables these
mouse bindings:

</P>

<PRE>
      (define-key global-map [mode-line C-mouse-3] 'mouse-kill-this-buffer)
      (define-key global-map [mode-line S-mouse-3] 'mouse-bury-buffer))
      (define-key global-map [mode-line C-M-mouse-3] 'mouse-delete-frame)
</PRE>

<P>
globally (<CODE>mouse-delete-frame</CODE> might be useless if you prefer your
window manager's delete-frame command... ).  In <CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE>,
these bindings are enabled in its local map <CODE>dired-dd-mode-map</CODE>
regardless of the value of <CODE>dired-dd-use-modeline-binding-global</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that even if you setq <CODE>dired-dd-use-modeline-binding-global</CODE> to
non-nil, the bindings above are not enabled until <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> is loaded.
If you like these mouse binding, and want to use them globally from the
startup of emacs, include the binding codes above, and the function definitions
such as:

</P>

<PRE>
         (defun mouse-kill-this-buffer (e)
           (interactive "@e")
           (kill-this-buffer))
         (defun mouse-bury-buffer (e)
           (interactive "@e")
           (bury-buffer))
         (defun mouse-delete-frame (e &#38;optional arg)
           (interactive "@e\nP")
           (delete-frame (selected-frame) arg))
</PRE>

<P>
in your <TT>`~/.emacs'</TT>, which is a surer solution.  See also the
document string of <CODE>dired-dd-use-modeline-binding-global</CODE> with
<KBD>C-h v dired-dd-use-modeline-binding-global RET</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
The functions <CODE>mouse-kill-this-buffer</CODE>, <CODE>mouse-bury-buffer</CODE>
and <CODE>mouse-delete-frame</CODE> are defined at the end of the
<TT>`dired-dd.el'</TT>.

<P>
This section deals with the programs going well with <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>Dired</CODE> can operate not only on local file system but also ftp
directories.  Some <CODE>dired</CODE> related programs are known to handle
both local and ftp directories transparently, and they are all
compatible with <CODE>dired-dd</CODE>.<BR>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<TT>`ange-ftp.el'</TT><BR>

Included in normal emacs distribution, but currently it is implemented
in emacs so transparently that you might not be conscious about this
program at all.

So, some user may not know that he can open ftp directory in a
<CODE>dired</CODE> buffer by issuing command such as


<PRE>
<KBD>C-x d</KBD> <CODE>/ftp@ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu/</CODE> <KBD>RET</KBD>
</PRE>

The derived <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer can be operated as normal dired buffer,
which means <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> can be used too.  That is, you can ftp files
with drag and drop.

Find <TT>`url-to-ange.el'</TT> in <TT>`spinout'</TT> directory of
<CODE>dired-dd</CODE> distribution, which enables translation of URL
expression into ange-ftp expression, or opens URL location already
existing in emacs buffer.

You can also find <TT>`bookmark-thief.el'</TT> in <TT>`spinout'</TT> directory
which enables stealing bookmarkfile of <TT>`Mozilla'</TT> (Netscape
Navigator) and opening URL via external or internal browser, or opening
ftp URL via ange-ftp.  <TT>`bookmark-thief.el'</TT> requires
<TT>`browse-url.el'</TT> included in <TT>`html-helper-mode'</TT> package.<BR>

<LI>

<TT>`archie.el'</TT><BR>

It fetches <TT>`archie'</TT> command output, and can raise
ange-ftp-dired buffer with <KBD>d</KBD> command.
You can find <TT>`archie.el'</TT> in various places.  Use <CODE>xarchie</CODE>,
or your favorite WWW search engine.<BR>

<LI>

<TT>`locate-dired.el'</TT><BR>

This handles local file system.  Find it in <TT>`spinout'</TT>
directory of <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> distribution.  Works like <CODE>find-dired</CODE>, but
it uses <TT>`locate'</TT> command instead of <TT>`find'</TT> in the original <CODE>find-dired</CODE>.
<TT>`locate.el'</TT> is included in emacs-20.2, but unlike <TT>`locate.el'</TT>,
<TT>`locate-dired.el'</TT> uses <CODE>dired-mode</CODE>, so that you can use
<CODE>dired-dd-mode</CODE> in the output buffer.<BR>

<LI>

<TT>`bookmark-popmenu.el'</TT><BR>

Emacs bookmark is convenient while moving around local (and maybe
FTP) file system, but sometimes the menu-bar appears to be so far away, if
you are in the `mouse (lazy) mode'.
<TT>`bookmark-popmenu.el'</TT>,
also included in <TT>`spinout'</TT> directory of <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> distribution,
pops up emacs bookmark menu (`stolen' from <CODE>menu-bar</CODE> keymap)
by <KBD>C-M-mouse-2</KBD>
and its jump menu by <KBD>C-M-mouse-1</KBD>.

Included in normal emacs distribution (At least emacs-20.2 have
this.  Probably older emacs-19.xx does not).<BR>

<LI>

<TT>`mldrag.el'</TT><BR>

Drags scroll-bar with <KBD>vertical-scroll-bar S-down-mouse-1</KBD>
to change window width.  Included in normal emacs distribution.
In emacs-20.2, the vertical scroll bar should be
located to the right of a window to use <TT>`mldrag.el'</TT>
(or you can't drag scroll bar horisontally to change the window width).<BR>

<LI>

<TT>`windows.el'</TT><BR>

An Emacs Window Manager.
Operates multiple emacs frames easily with keyboard command.
You can also save or restore window / frame configuration with
<TT>`windows.el'</TT>.  Perhaps you can find it at

Emacs may blows away if you push <CODE>close</CODE> button of <STRONG>yes-no</STRONG>
dialog box.  It's not a <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> bug, but might be a serious bug
of emacs, or window manager.  The author observed it in mule-2.3 (19.28)
and emacs-20.2, on window managers WindowMaker, fvwm2, and AfterStep.
It is safer not to decorate transient window or not to put <CODE>close</CODE>
button on it, if your window manager has such capability.
<BR>

<LI>

Emacs-19.xx can not correctly interpret shell variable registered in
<CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>. For example,


<PRE>
(setq dired-guess-shell-alist-user
      (cons (list "\\.r[ma]$\\|\\.ram$"
             "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/rvplayer5.0b2 ~/rvplayer5.0b2/rvplayer *")
            dired-guess-shell-alist-user))
</PRE>

won't run (but runs good in emacs-20). In emacs-19, you must put


<PRE>
(setq dired-guess-shell-alist-user
      (cons (list "\\.r[ma]$\\|\\.ram$"
             "~/bin/Rvplayer *")
            dired-guess-shell-alist-user))
</PRE>

with making the <CODE>"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=..."</CODE> part as a shell script
<TT>`~/bin/Rvplayer'</TT>.  It seems that <TT>`='</TT> is not correctly
interpreted.  This is not a <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> specific limitation, but
applies also when you invoke related command with keyboard command
<KBD>!</KBD> from <CODE>dired</CODE> buffer, FYI.

<BR>
Further, Emacs-19.xx might not correctly interpret <TT>`sh'</TT> command
<CODE>"exec"</CODE> registered in <CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>, for
example in issuing command <KBD>M-mouse-2</KBD>
(<CODE>dired-dd-exec-command-directly</CODE>).  It is a shame, because
sometimes you can save memory by amount of one shell with including
<CODE>"exec"</CODE> in <CODE>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</CODE>.

The problem below occurs in mouse-focus type of window manager settings
in which you can operate a window (frame, in emacs terminology) placed
underneath some other window.  If you are using a
click-to-focus(-and-raise-frame) type of window manager setting, the
description below does not applied.
<BR>

In current <CODE>dired-dd</CODE> under a mouse-focus type of window manager
setting, if a frame <CODE>A</CODE> is wrapped over a frame <CODE>B</CODE> as shown
below, drag-and-drop from frame <CODE>B</CODE> to <CODE>A</CODE> may not work as you
you expect always.


<PRE>
         +-----------+       
         |           |     
         |   b  +-----------+

         +------|- - +  a1  |
         B      |           |
                +-----------+
                A
</PRE>

That is, if you dropped object(s) from area <CODE>b</CODE> of frame <CODE>B</CODE>
into area <CODE>a2</CODE> of frame <CODE>A</CODE> underneath which frame <CODE>B</CODE>
exists, this drop would be still regarded as a drop into frame <CODE>B</CODE>.
To avoid this problem, always drag object(s) from area <CODE>b</CODE> into
area <CODE>a1</CODE> underneath which frame <CODE>B</CODE> does not exist, or, if
you make the operation surer, simply raise frame <CODE>B</CODE> over <CODE>A</CODE>
prior to the dragging. 
<BR>

This is one of serious bug of emacs builtin primitive function
(special-form ?)  <CODE>track-mouse</CODE> used in function
<CODE>dired-drag-drop</CODE>.  <CODE>Track-mouse</CODE> cannot understand over-wrap
situation of emacs frames, and knows out-of-the-frame status only by
detecting simply if the mouse pointer is off the frame (the outline of
the frame).
<BR>

I just don't know whether the problem occurs in combination with every
window manager or not.  The problem is observed in (fvwm2-2.0.46 +
emacs-20.2 or mule-2.3 (19.28)) environment.
