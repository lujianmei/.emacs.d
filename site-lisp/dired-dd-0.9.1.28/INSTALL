INSTALLING dired-dd
-------------------

If you are mule-2.3 (19.28) user,

$ make emacs=mule compile
$ su
# make emacs=mule elispdir=/usr/local/lib/mule/site-lisp install

If you are emacs-20.x user,

$ make emacs=emacs compile
$ su
# make emacs=emacs elispdir=/usr/local/emacs-20.2/share/emacs/site-lisp install

If you do not have write permission for {mule,emacs}/site-lisp above,
or if you want to install dired-dd into private directory, the second
line invoking `make' in the examples above may be:

$ make emacs=mule elispdir=~/your_dired-dd_dir install

If directory ~/your_dired-dd_dir is not included in load-path, you must put

(setq load-path (cons "~/your_dired-dd_dir" load-path))

in your ~/.emacs.

In 19.34 based mule-2.3, probably similar path can be specified.

The entity of mule/emacs or the {mule,emacs}/site-lisp path in your
environment may differ from the examples above.  Consult your system
administrator.

In the Makefile included in the distribution, default emacs and elispdir are
defined as:

emacs=/usr/local/emacs-20.2/bin/emacs
elispdir=~/elisp

Sorry for the inconvenience.


----------------
LOADING dired-dd
----------------

Include something like

(add-hook
 'dired-load-hook
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (load "dired-x")
    ;; Set dired-x variables here.
    ;; To and flo...
    (if window-system (require 'dired-dd)))))

in your ~/.emacs (or any startup file).

See attached dired-dd.info for detailed informations.

After 0.9.1.11, dired-dd-mew.el (very experimental and cheap) should
be included in the distribution to support drag drop into Mew's draft
buffer.

If you want to load dired-dd-mew.el as well, include something like

(add-hook
 'dired-load-hook
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (load "dired-x")
    ;; Set dired-x variables here.
    ;; To and flo...
    (if window-system
	(progn (require 'dired-dd)
	       (require 'dired-dd-mew))))))

dired-dd-insert-file.el or dired-dd-insert-fname.el can be loaded
similarly. If you want to load all of the three the add-hook code might be:

(add-hook
 'dired-load-hook
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (load "dired-x")
    ;; Set dired-x variables here.
    ;; To and flo...
    (if window-system
	(progn (require 'dired-dd)
	       (require 'dired-dd-mew)
	       (require 'dired-dd-insert-fname)
	       (require 'dired-dd-insert-file))))))
